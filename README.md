# Project: RAG-Based User Query Application to Generate Answers
## Description:
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based application that takes a user query, finds relevant information from a knowledge base, and generates accurate, context-aware answers. It combines retrieval and generation to improve answer quality over simple language models.
## Key Features:
- Accepts user queries through a simple interface
- Retrieves relevant information from documents or a knowledge base
- Generates answers using the retrieved context
- Logs queries, answers, and timestamps for tracking and analysis
- Can be extended with better retrieval models or larger datasets
## Tools & Technology Stack:
- Python 3.x
- Natural Language Processing libraries (like transformers, sentence-transformers)
- Vector search / embedding libraries (FAISS or similar)
- CSV for logging query-response data
- Optional APIs for external LLMs (if needed)
## How It Works:
1. User inputs a query in the interface.
2. The backend retrieves relevant documents or passages from the knowledge base.
3. Retrieved information is combined with the user query.
4. A generative model produces the final answer using the augmented context.
5. The system displays the answer and logs it along with the query and timestamp.
## Output:
- Answer to the user query displayed in the interface
- Logged data stored in `log.csv` for review
- Optional summary or explanation if the model supports it

#### This project demonstrates a simple but effective RAG system, showing how retrieval plus generation can create smarter and more accurate answers for user queries.
